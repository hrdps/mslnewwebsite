  <span><strong> Dawn of Quantum Computing</strong></span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >In 2023, IBM introduced its 433-qubit Osprey processor, while Google&apos;s
    Sycamore demonstrated quantum supremacy by completing a calculation in just
    200 seconds&mdash;something that would take the fastest classical
    supercomputers over 10,000 years. These breakthroughs are not just
    milestones; they signal a monumental leap from theory to reality. Quantum
    computing is here, and it&rsquo;s set to revolutionize artificial
    intelligence and reshape entire industries.</span
